    We encourage you to be creative, but we also want to help you show the best of the best from your runs. That is why we created templates and gathered them for your and some of our favorites in this guide. <br><br>
    To ensure a consistent and professional visual identity across all teams and communication channels, please make use of our official Figma Guide. <br><br>

    <span class="bold-text">The guide includes</span> <br>  
    
- Brand colors and typography <br>
- Logos and graphic elements <br>
- Templates for social media posts <br>
- Layout guidelines for announcements and updates <br> <br>
Make sure to review the Figma Guide before creating any visual materials, so all content aligns with our overall branding.

  <h2>Don’ts:</h2>
  <p>
   Do not alter, weaken, or reduce our brand’s colors, typography, or visual features. Always follow the original MRC style or your chapter’s approved style — and avoid any treatments that compromise the integrity or clarity of the identity.
