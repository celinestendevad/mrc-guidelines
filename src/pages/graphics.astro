  <h2>Rules</h2>
  <p>
    It is not allowed to create or use any graphics that haven’t been approved.
    If you have a specific idea or request, please reach out to us, and we’ll
    let you know if it’s possible.
  </p>

<div class="text-row">
  <h2>Information</h2>
  <p>
    Clear, well-structured graphics help runners quickly find what they need:
    meeting points, routes, event times, chapter updates, and partnerships. The
    easier it is to understand, the more likely people are to join and return.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="text-row">
  <h2>Strengths</h2>
  <p>
    When members see the same visual language everywhere, it reinforces that
    they’re part of something bigger. Good design builds emotional connection —
    the feeling of “I’m part of this tribe,” which is central to the spirit of
    MRC.

<div class="text-row">
  <h2>How</h2>
  <p>
    To maintain a consistent and professional visual identity across all
    platforms, it is not permitted to create or use self-made illustrations,
    graphics, or design elements without prior approval. All visual material
    must follow our official branding guidelines to ensure that the MRC identity
    is represented accurately, uniformly, and in accordance with copyright and
    brand standards. We reserve the right to moderate or remove any posts,
    comments, or content that go against these guidelines, breach Mikkeller’s
    policies, or violate the law.
