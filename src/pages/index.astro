  <h2>our mission</h2>
  <p> Mikkeller Running Club brings people together through social running and the joy of great beer. We create inclusive spaces — in more than 100 chapters worldwide where anyone, regardless of experience or pace, can show up, run, and connect. 
<br> <br>Through our events, tours, and everyday meetups, we balance an active lifestyle with the simple pleasure of sharing a post-run beer, building a vibrant international community driven by curiosity, friendship, and adventure.

<h2>brand pillars</h2>
<div>
    <p class="bold-text">Community & Camaraderie </p> <p> We are a welcoming, international family of runners. Our chapters foster genuine connections, open arms, and shared moments — on the run and over a beer. <br>
<br> <p class="bold-text">Inclusivity & Accessibility </p> <p> Everyone is invited. Whether you’re new or experienced, fast or slow, beer-lover or alcohol-free, MRC is a space where you can come as you are and feel part of the pack.  <br>
<br></p> <p class="bold-text">Adventure & Exploration </p>  <p> We encourage curiosity. From local routes to global tours and beer festivals, we invite members to explore new places, push their boundaries, and embrace a spirit of discovery.  <br>
<br> <p class="bold-text">Balance & Enjoyment </p> <p>Running should be fun. We celebrate the harmony between staying active and enjoying great beer — promoting a lifestyle rooted in health, joy, and balance rather than competition.    </p>
